RPC::ExtDirect::Client
======================

    This module implements Ext.Direct client in pure Perl. Its main purpose
    is to be used for testing server side Ext.Direct classes, complementing
    RPC::ExtDirect::Server. It can also be used for testing Ext.Direct
    Actions developed in languages other than Perl, or for something else
    altogether.

    This client is synchronous, i.e. all method calls are blocking. If you
    need a non-blocking way of calling an Ext.Direct server, take a look at
    RPC::ExtDirect::Client::Async instead.

    Unless configured otherwise, RPC::ExtDirect::Client will use HTTP::Tiny
    for the transport layer.
